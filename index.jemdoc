== About me
I received my Bachelors and Masters degree in *Electrical engineering* from *Jadavpur University* ([http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/view_department.php?deptid=58 JU]) and *Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur* ([https://www.iitk.ac.in/ee/ IIT]) in India, in 2012 and 2014, respectively. I worked as a project associate for a year at IIT Kanpur. In September 2015, I joined the PhD program in *Aerospace engineering* at Texas A&M University, under the supervision of [https://engineering.tamu.edu/aerospace/profiles/rbhattacharya.html  *Raktim Bhattacharya*].
