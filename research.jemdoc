== Sensor Architecture Design
Sensors are in integral part of a system, providing knowledge about system states, through state
filtering, which can further be utilized to control the system. The problem of sensor design addresses questions
regarding, $\color{red}{{}^1}$which type of sensors do we need, $\color{red}{{}^2}$how accurate sensors do we need, and $\color{red}{{}^3}$when and where do we use
them for a particular type of filtering scheme.

== Situational Awareness
- *Space Situational Awareness*\n
Space situational awareness (SSA) refers to the ability to view, understand and predict the
physical location of natural and manmade objects in orbit around the Earth.  Our research leverages upon a non-linear filtering technique known as Optimal Transport filter, to provide better probabilistic information about states of each of those space objects.
