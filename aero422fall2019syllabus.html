<p><b>Instructor:</b> Niladri Das, niladridas@tamu.edu | <b>Office Hours:</b> TBD or by appointment</p>
<p><b>TA:</b> TBD | <b>Office Hours:</b> TBD or by appt.</p>
<p><b>Lecture:</b> Monday, Wednesday, &amp; Friday  9:10am - 10:00am @ Reed-McDonald Building Room 202</p>
<p><b>PreReqs:</b> Undergraduate level AERO 321 Min. Grade of C or Undergraduate level AERO 421 Min. Grade of C</p>
<p><b>Course Duration:</b> August 26 - December 11, 2019</p>
<p><b>Catalog Description</b><br />
Introduction to the Theory of Automatic Control specifically applied to aerospace vehicles; techniques for analysis and synthesis of linear control systems, stability criteria, systems response and performance criteria; design studies of active controls to improve aerospace vehicle performance.</p>
<p><b>Learning Outcomes or Course Objectives</b><br />
This course is designed to introduce students to the basics of programming with modern programming languages in the context of development for and with GIS. Students will learn how to apply this knowledge to develop custom GIS applications and extensions that solve real-world problems. This course will provide students with a solid foundation in fundamental programming techniques and the knowledge to apply these techniques within GIS programming domains.</p>
<p>The course will start with an introduction to fundamental programming structures and techniques and quickly advance to programming issues related to developing for GIS platforms including integration of their code into industry standard GIS platforms to extend the capabilities of these systems.</p>
<p>The course will include a lecture component where theoretical issues are covered, and homework and lab-based exercises where students have the opportunity to practice implementing these techniques in various programming languages including Python and C
This course will also include identification of and interaction with a real-world “customer” who needs GIS programming. Students will learn software project management skills while participating in a team led by a graduate student and have the opportunity to interact with a real-world “customer” to experience the identification and translation of customer requirements into application development.</p>
<p>At the end of this class, each student will be able to:<br />
1. Identify a set of requirements for the development of a software system;<br />
2. Implement standalone programming projects in Python and C
3. Integrate custom code into ArcGIS that customizes, automates, and extents its functionality;<br />
4. Programmatically access GIS data and use these data in GIS modeling, computation, visualization, and analysis; and<br />
5. Conceptualize, design, plan, implement, and document a custom GIS programming solution to a real-world problem.</p>
<p>There are are in-class tutorials which you are expected to work through. There are also homework assignments . For questions, please use the Canvas discussion boards as your first option so that your questions/answers can help other students with the same issues. Your instructor will closely follow these discussion boards, and will post responses there.</p>
<p><b>Email</b> <br />
All Texas A&amp;M students <b>should use their university-associated email accounts</b> when emailing the instructor and teaching assistants.</p>
<p><b>Textbook and/or Resource Material</b><br />
No required textbooks. Course readings will include online texts, and other videos, resources, and materials provided by the instructor.<br />
<b></b>Optional textbooks: TBD<b></b><br />
<b></b>Optional Course Lectures:<b></b> Dr. Raktim Bhattacharya's course notes for AERO-422 are <a href="https://isrlab.github.io/tutorials.html" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>available here</a></p>
<p><b>Attendance and make-up policies</b><br />
Attendance is mandatory for all classes and events. This course will follow the <a href="http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07" target=&ldquo;blank&rdquo;>University’s policy</a> if a student cannot complete assigned activities by their deadlines due to excused absences. Makeups for exams and other work will be allowed only for University excused absences and will be administered in compliance with university rules. Incompletes will not be given in this class.</p>
<p><b>Homeworks</b><br />
Homeworks are important and integral portions of the course. There is simply no way to learn without spending considerable time on your own working on problems. The homeworks will typically require time outside of the scheduled class. Homeworks <b>will  not be accepted for credit</b> unless covered by a University excused absence. It is your responsibility for keeping up with assignments. You should talk to your <b>TA</b> and or the <b>instructor</b> <b>BEFORE</b> late assignments become a problem.</p>
<p><b>Grading Policies</b> <br /> Your grade in this class will be based on the following:<br />
1. Problem Sets (50%)<br />
2. Take-home Mid-term Exam(30%)<br />
3. Final Exam (20%)</p>
<p><b>Academic Integrity</b><br />
Aggie Code of Honor. For many years Aggies have followed a Code of Honor, which is stated in this very simple verse:
<b>&ldquo;An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do.&rdquo;</b>
The Aggie Code of Honor is an effort to unify the aims of all Texas A&amp;M men and women toward a high code of ethics and personal dignity. For most, living under this code will be no problem, as it asks nothing of a person that is beyond reason. It only calls for honesty and integrity, characteristics that Aggies have always exemplified. The Aggie Code of Honor functions as a symbol to all Aggies, promoting understanding and loyalty to truth and confidence in each other.

<p><b>Due Dates and Time Zones</b><br />
All homework and other assignments will be due following the class that they were assigned, unless otherwise indicated on the assignment.</p>
