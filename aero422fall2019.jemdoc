*Attendance and make-up policies*\n
Attendance is mandatory for all classes and events. This course will follow the [http://student-rules.tamu.edu/rule07 University’s policy] if a student cannot complete assigned activities by their deadlines due to excused absences. Makeups for exams and other work will be allowed only for University excused absences and will be administered in compliance with university rules. Incompletes will not be given in this class.

#As described in the grade section of this syllabus, a portion of each #student’s grade is based on in-class participation. This will be judged by the #instructor as **regular attendance** and **active engagement** on a consistent #basis that **contributes to the class** in some manner.

*Homeworks*\n
Homeworks are important and integral portions of the course. There is simply no way to learn without spending considerable time on your own working on problems. The homeworks will typically require time outside of the scheduled class. Homeworks *will  not be accepted for credit* unless covered by a University excused absence. It is your responsibility for keeping up with assignments. You should talk to your *TA* and or the *instructor* *BEFORE* late assignments become a problem.

*Academic Integrity*\n
Aggie Code of Honor. For many years Aggies have followed a Code of Honor, which is stated in this very simple verse:
*"An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do."*
The Aggie Code of Honor is an effort to unify the aims of all Texas A&M men and women toward a high code of ethics and personal dignity. For most, living under this code will be no problem, as it asks nothing of a person that is beyond reason. It only calls for honesty and integrity, characteristics that Aggies have always exemplified. The Aggie Code of Honor functions as a symbol to all Aggies, promoting understanding and loyalty to truth and confidence in each other.
